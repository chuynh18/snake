Snake
=====

This is a game that has been implemented and reimplemented who knows how many times.  Now it's my turn.

Click start, then use the arrow keys to move.  On a mobile device?  There (should be) virtual "buttons" for you to use.

When you collect the fruit, your snake grows by one segment, and also slithers more quickly.

I wrote this mainly because I wanted to make a "real-time" game.  Turns out it was considerably easier than [Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/chuynh18/tictactoe/) and [Four-in-a-row](https://github.com/chuynh18/fourinarow/).
